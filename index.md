An ESP32 based presence detection node for use with the [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) [`mqtt_room` component](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/sensor.mqtt_room/) for localized device presence detection. This is a Fork/rewrite of [ESP32-mqtt-room](https://jptrsn.github.io/ESP32-mqtt-room).

## Differences from ESP32-mqtt-room

* SUPER Easy Browser based installation
* Captive portal for easy WiFi setup
* Home Assistant MQTT Discovery for easy HA configuration
* Auto-updates by downloading github released bin (with a preference if you don't want this)
* Uses a fingerprint instead of mac addresses so we can track randomized mac devices (like Apple Watches and iOS devices)
* Filters measured distance with botah a median prefilter and a Kalman filter (reduces jitter for more accuracy)
* Fully multithreaded, uses constant BLE scanning, doesn't disable wdt (more reliable)
* Additional [AppDaemon app](https://github.com/ESPresense/ad-espresense-ips) that attempts to solve indoor position (x,y,z) with multiple ESPresense stations using multilateralization.
* Additional sensors supported, like Motion detectors or temperatur/humidity sensors.

## Credits

This depends heavily on the hard work done by a number of people:

* **ESP32-room-assistant** [(GitHub)](https://jptrsn.github.io/ESP32-mqtt-room/index.html#credits).  All credit for the intial codebase goes to him!
* **Web Serial Terminal** [(Github)](https://github.com/rafaelaroca/web-serial-terminal) - Very nice terminal using web serial
* **pcbreflux** [(GitHub)](https://github.com/pcbreflux) [(YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvsMfEoIu_ZdBIgQVcY_AZA) - this code takes heavy inspiration from [ESP32_BLE_beaconscan](https://github.com/pcbreflux/espressif/tree/master/esp32/arduino/sketchbook/ESP32_BLE_beaconscan)
* **Neil Kolban** [(GitHub)](https://github.com/nkolban) [(YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChKn_BlaVrMrhEquPNI6HuQ) - provided the [Bluetooth low enery libraries](https://github.com/nkolban/esp32-snippets) used
* **Marvin Roger** [(GitHub)](https://github.com/marvinroger) - provided the [Async MQTT library](http://marvinroger.viewdocs.io/async-mqtt-client/)
* **Benoit Blanchon** [(GitHub)](https://github.com/bblanchon) [(YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8HZRqN4wfytHfRGMLUQWkQ) - provided the [Arduino JSON library](https://arduinojson.org/)
* **Me No Dev** [(GitHub)](https://github.com/me-no-dev) - provided the [Async TCP library](https://github.com/me-no-dev/AsyncTCP)
* **Kyle Gordon** [(GitHub)](https://github.com/kylegordon) - wrote the necessary code for PlatformIO support
